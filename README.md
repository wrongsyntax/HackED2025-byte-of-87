## 🔥 Inspiration  

In **2021 alone**, Statistics Canada reported **15,395 indoor fires**, emphasizing the **urgent need** for better fire detection and response systems.  

Not all fires are the same:  
- **Water can worsen grease fires**  
- **Electrical fires require specific extinguishers**  

However, studies show that **over 60% of people** do not know which extinguisher to use in an emergency. This **lack of awareness increases the risk of injuries** and fire spreading.  

💡 Our goal? A system that **not only detects fire** but also **classifies it** and provides **instant, accurate response instructions** to **prevent further damage and save lives**.

## ⚙️ How We Built It  

**Dataset:** Curated and preprocessed fire-related images obtained from Roboflow for **accurate detection**.  
**Computer Vision:** Used **YOLOv8** to train a model for fire classification.  
**Real-Time Processing:** Raspberry Pi + camera + **servo motor scanning** for fire outbreaks.  
**Recommendation System:**  
   - Detects fire & identifies its type.  
   - Provides **real-time safety instructions** on the appropriate extinguishing method.  
   - **Delivers guidance via speaker** to help users act **immediately and correctly**.
